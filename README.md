Created to take stock data from yahoo charts.

Intraday data can be scraped by manually capturing the image of the stock price as the cursour moves across the screen of a stock chart.

This project was to see the feasibility of this method and it works decently. Althrough there are better alternatives to gathering intraday stock information.
